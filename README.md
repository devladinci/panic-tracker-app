**PanicTracker** is a mobile app that helps users track and manage panic attacks through structured journaling and symptom logging. It’s designed to be a calming, private companion during stressful moments.

## 💬 The Story

Four years ago, I created this app to support people struggling with panic attacks — including myself. It was always free, with no ads or paywalls. Now I’m open-sourcing it so others can learn from it, contribute, or adapt it for their own communities.
